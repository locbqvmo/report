# report

# Welcome everyone to this repository, we are going to use this as a place for everyone to send in their reports

## IMPORTANT: If any member in the group overrides other members' report on github has to report back to the group. That person also has to redo the report of the one they override.

## Read `commit-rule.md`

## Guides to work with `report`:

- Clone the project to your machine using SSH key
- Create a branch for you using your name. For example, your name is Nguyen Van A, therefore your branch will be nguyen-van-a
- At the start of the day, everyone has to write their report into the file `start-day-reports.md`, commit your change and push to your own branch. After that, create a Pull Request on github to the branch `master`. If there is no conflict, feel free to merge. If there is any conflicts, you have to resolve the conflicts first. My advice is to pull from branch `master` first before push it to your branch, and then create a Pull Request.
- Each person will create a folder according yo your name and create md files for end of the day reports

```
- nguyen-van-a
--- report-27-07.md
--- report-28-07.md
```

- For each topic in your report, you can add some code samples to illustrate your report. For example:

```js
function calculation() {
  return ...
}
```

- Everyone needs to use terminal to use Git
