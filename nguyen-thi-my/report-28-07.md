**HTML Semantic**

HTML Semantic is a way of writing HTML that uses HTML tags according to the content contained in it, not using tags in the way that we want the content in it to be displayed.

<-- Some dividers of page content -->
  1. The <section></section> tag
  The <section> tag is used to separate HTML segments or a piece of page content. The section tag is used for about , contact, and content sections in the page.
  2. The <article></article> tag
  The <article> used to store independent content on the page. And if that content is taken elsewhere, users can still understand it
  3. The <aside></aside> tag
  The <aside> tag is used to store side information and can be deleted without affecting the content of the page. And usually in the <article> tag
  4. The <main></main> tag
  The <main> tag is used to contain the main content of the page, it will not contain information such as <header>, <footer>, <aside>
  Note: There is only one <main> tag in a page
  5. The <div></div> tag
  The <div> tag is a tag that has no Semantic meaning. It is only used to wrap related content together. When we can't find the right tag to wrap that content, we will use the div tag.
  6. The <header></header>
  The <header> tag wraps introductory information about the entire site.
  7. The <footer></footer> tag
  The <footer> tag wraps information about the website, the footer tag of the entire page usually contains contact information
