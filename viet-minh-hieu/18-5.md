## Javascript

**This & Object prototypes**

- A function's this keyword behaves a little differently in JavaScript compared to other languages. It also has some differences between strict mode and non-strict mode.
- Prototypes are the mechanism by which JavaScript objects inherit features from one another. In this article, we explain what a prototype is, how prototype chains work, and how a prototype for an object can be set.
<script>
const person = {
  name: 'Hieu',
  age: 18,
  address: "Ha Noi"
  eat() {
    console.log(`${this.name} in ${this.address} is eating rice`);
  }
}
console.log(person.eat())
</script>
