1. Web workers

- Web Workers are a feature in JavaScript that allow web applications to offload tasks to separate background threads. This helps in keeping the main thread responsive and prevents it from being blocked or slowed down by time-consuming operations. Web Workers can perform tasks such as heavy computations, data processing, or network requests without affecting the user interface.

- Here's an example of using a web worker to perform a time-consuming task:

```javascript
// main.js
const worker = new Worker("worker.js");

worker.onmessage = function (event) {
  console.log("Result:", event.data);
};

worker.postMessage(1000000); // Send a message to the worker

// worker.js
self.onmessage = function (event) {
  const number = event.data;
  const result = calculateFactorial(number);
  self.postMessage(result); // Send the result back to the main thread
};

function calculateFactorial(number) {
  let factorial = 1;
  for (let i = 1; i <= number; i++) {
    factorial *= i;
  }
  return factorial;
}
```

- In this example, the main script creates a new web worker using the Worker constructor and specifies the worker script file (worker.js). The main script listens for messages from the worker using the onmessage event handler. When the worker finishes its task, it sends the result back to the main script using the postMessage method.

- The worker script (worker.js) receives the message from the main script using the onmessage event handler. It performs a time-consuming task of calculating the factorial of the number received. Once the calculation is done, it sends the result back to the main script using the postMessage method.

2. Web Sockets

- The WebSocket API is an advanced technology that allows for two-way interactive communication between a user's browser and a server. It enables sending messages to a server and receiving event-driven responses without the need to continuously poll the server for a reply.

- To create a WebSocket connection, you can use the WebSocket object and its constructor, WebSocket(). This object provides the API for managing the WebSocket connection, as well as sending and receiving data on the connection.

- Here's an example of how to create a WebSocket connection in JavaScript:

```javascript
// Create a new WebSocket object
const socket = new WebSocket("wss://example.com/socket");

// Event listener for when the connection is established
socket.onopen = function () {
  console.log("WebSocket connection established.");

  // Send a message to the server
  socket.send("Hello, server!");
};

// Event listener for receiving messages from the server
socket.onmessage = function (event) {
  console.log("Received message from server:", event.data);
};

// Event listener for when the connection is closed
socket.onclose = function () {
  console.log("WebSocket connection closed.");
};
```

- In this example, we create a new WebSocket object and specify the URL of the server to connect to. We then define event listeners for the onopen, onmessage, and onclose events to handle the different stages of the WebSocket connection.

- When the connection is established (onopen event), we send a message to the server using the send() method. When a message is received from the server (onmessage event), we log the message to the console. Finally, when the connection is closed (onclose event), we log a message indicating that the WebSocket connection has been closed.
