   | The CSS Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout. | Flexbox is made for one-dimensional layouts, and the Grid is made for two-dimensional layouts. It means Flexbox can work on either rows or columns at a time, but Grids can work on both. |

2. Media queries

- The @media rule, introduced in CSS2, made it possible to define different style rules for different media types.
- Media queries in CSS3 extended the CSS2 media types idea: Instead of looking for a type of device, they look at the capability of the device.

- Media queries can be used to check many things, such as:
  - width and height of the viewport
  - width and height of the device
  - orientation (is the tablet/phone in landscape or portrait mode?)
  - resolution
