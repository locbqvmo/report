1. SSE ( Server-sent events ) - Web APIs

- Server-sent events (SSE) is a technology that allows a server to send real-time updates to a client over a single HTTP connection. It provides a simple and efficient way to push data from the server to the client without the need for the client to continuously poll the server for updates.

- To use server-sent events, you'll need to set up a server that can stream events to the client. On the client side, you can use the EventSource interface to establish a connection and handle incoming events.

> > Here's an example of how to use server-sent events in JavaScript:

```javascript
const eventSource = new EventSource("/stream"); // Establish a connection to the server

eventSource.addEventListener("message", (event) => {
  const data = JSON.parse(event.data); // Parse the incoming data
  console.log("Received message:", data);
});

eventSource.addEventListener("error", (event) => {
  console.error("Error occurred:", event);
});

eventSource.addEventListener("open", () => {
  console.log("Connection opened");
});

eventSource.addEventListener("close", () => {
  console.log("Connection closed");
});
```

- In this example, we create a new EventSource object and pass the URL /stream to establish a connection with the server. We then add event listeners to handle different types of events.

  - The message event is triggered when the server sends a message. We parse the incoming data using JSON.parse() and log it to the console.
  - The error event is triggered if an error occurs during the connection.
  - The open event is triggered when the connection is successfully opened.
  - The close event is triggered when the connection is closed.
