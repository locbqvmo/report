* CSS:
- Flexbox (50%)
	-> flexbox is a layout module, it helps developers can be able to change the position of elements or arrange elements in a block flexibility. Imagine that we have a div block which is parents elements and two div children, then we want to set each child will be places at each side of parents. 
	- Back for few years ago, we would set the display property inline-block for each child, then margin them. But at present, we set display property flex for parents and add justify-content with space-between, so we can deal with the problems easier than before.
	- Code example: 
        .parents {		
            width: 100%;
    	    display: flex;
		    justify-content: space-between;
	    }
