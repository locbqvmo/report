2. Media Queries

- Media queries are a way to apply CSS styles depending on a device's general type (such as mobile vs screen) or other characteristics such as screen resolution or browser viewport width.

- Media queries are commonly associated with CSS, but they can be used in HTML and JavaScript as well.

Example in Css:

```
@media only screen and (min-device-width: 320px) and (max-device-width: 480px) {
  .card {
    background: #bada55;
  }
}
```

Example in Javascript:

```
const mediaQuery = window.matchMedia('(min-width: 768px)')

function handleTabletChange(e) {
  if (e.matches) {
    console.log('Media Query Matched!')
  }
}

mediaQuery.addListener(handleTabletChange)

handleTabletChange(mediaQuery)
```

3. Animations

- Animation properties:
  - @keyframes
  - animation-name
  - animation-duration
  - animation-delay
  - animation-iteration-count
  - animation-direction
  - animation-timing-function
  - animation-fill-mode
  - animation

5. TailwindCSS

- What is TailwindCSS? TailwindCSS is a utility-first CSS framework designed to create css faster and reusable.

- How TailwindCSS works? By scanning all of your HTML files, JavaScript components, and any other templates for class names, generating the corresponding styles and then writing them to a static CSS file.

- TailwindCSS vs SASS/SCSS:
  - Tailwind is a much faster framework compared to SASS, because it does not require the compilation of code.
  - Using Tailwind CSS you donâ€™t need to worry about classes clashing or coming up with your Classes.
  - SASS/SCSS has powerful features that are not available in vanilla CSS such as variables, loops...
  - TailwindCSS everything you need is in one file. While SASS/SCSS need to add styling to every components.
