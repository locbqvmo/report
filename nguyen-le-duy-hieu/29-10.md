### Advanced Javascript Concept

1. Web Workers

- Web Workers are a simple means for web content to run scripts in background threads. The worker thread can perform tasks without interfering with the user interface.

=> This is a way to increase performance in a web page without having to wait for the responses then executing next task.

- Web Workers API: A worker is an object created using a constructor (e.g. Worker()) that runs a named JavaScript file â€” this file contains the code that will run in the worker thread; workers run in another global context that is different from the current window.

=> Because Javascript is a one thread lanague so basically web worker api create another pseudo-thread to execute parallel with main thread.

NOTE: web workers api cannot access to DOM and only sends data to main script by api.

Example:

```
sumButton.addEventListener("click",()=>{
    let sum=0;
    for(let i=0;i<1000000000;i++){
        sum+=i;
    }

    alert(`The final sum is ${sum}`);
})

bgButton.addEventListener("click",()=>{
    if(document.body.style.background!=="green){
        document.body.style.background="green"
    }
    else{
        document.body.style.background="red"
    }
})
```

// script.js
const worker = new Worker('worker.js')

-> This is without web workers api, you have to wait bunch of time and cant change background color right away.
But with web workers api:

```
sumButton.addEventListener("click",()=>{
    worker.postMessage('hello')
})

worker.onmessage = function(message){
    console.log(message.data) // sum
}

bgButton.addEventListener("click",()=>{
    if(document.body.style.background!=="green){
        document.body.style.background="green"
    }
    else{
        document.body.style.background="red"
    }
})

// worker.js
onmessage = function(message){
    let sum=0;
    for(let i=0;i<1000000000;i++){
        sum+=i;
    }
    postMessage(sum)
}
```

-> You can still press while program is executing sum

- Terminating a worker: If you need to immediately terminate a running worker from the main thread, you can do so by calling the worker's terminate method: .terminate();
